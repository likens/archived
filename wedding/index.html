				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>We met over the summer of 2012 via an online dating service. We began talking for around a month until we finally met for the first time at Red Robin. We talked for what seemed like hours while a severe thunderstorm raged outside and found out we had plenty in common. After many dates and meeting each others "<strong>unique</strong>" families, we decided to make it official and see where life might take us.</p>
				<h3>The Proposal</h3>
				<p>After I was asked to take over the role of Santa at our family's Christmas party, I knew I had the perfect opportunity to surprise her! With Kasey being the last person to sit on Santa's lap, and a special surprise awaiting her in the bag, I asked her to marry me and shocked my whole family. Unfortunately, Kasey would not accept the proposal unless I got down on one knee. With that being said, on December 24, 2014, Kasey accepted my proposal to marry me.</p>
